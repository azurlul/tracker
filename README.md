# Tracker
- A python program to keep a track of clash of clans players nickname changes history and bans.
- This program will update the json automatically and send a webhook notification to a discord channel.
- Re-check the "players.json" list every 5 minutes.



Used by me a long time ago to keep a track of players with "stange" stones bases. (All tags are in "players.json")
